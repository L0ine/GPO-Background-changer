# WAK-Desktop-fixes

Tools to bypass restrictive GPO settings for Wallpaper and Taskbar on Windows 11.

## Features
- **Wallpaper Changer**: Forces wallpaper change by overwriting Windows cache (`TranscodedWallpaper`) and Registry keys.
- **Taskbar Fixes**: Centers the taskbar and hides labels (always combine) via Registry.
- **Silent & Auto-Discovery**: Automatically finds images in the folder and applies them without user interaction.
- **No Restart**: Applies settings without killing Explorer (where possible).

## Usage
1. Place your desired wallpaper (JPG/PNG) in this folder.
2. Run `setup.bat` once to install Autostart shortcuts.
3. Done! The fixes will apply on every login.

To run manually, executed `run.bat`.
